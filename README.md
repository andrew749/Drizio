##A Live Wallpaper for Android which  displays flickr photos.

Drizio is a simple live wallpaper. The app allows you to specify
a certain number of cached images, as well as the refresh period for the
wallpaper. These properties in turn are read by the underlying service running in the background.It is this service which displays a slideshow of images.
